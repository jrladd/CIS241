*This is the CIS department's guide to following instructions for **any** assignment.*

For your course, be aware of the various places that you might find information about expectations for completing and submitting assignments:

- The specification document or prompt for an assignment
- The syllabus for the course
- Relevant sections of the course website/Sakai site
- Teams, Emails or Sakai announcements or messages
- Instructions delivered verbally during class

# Let's get started

1. Before **beginning**, when planning your work, have you...

- outlined the complete set of tasks and any intermediate deadlines for those tasks as well as any task dependencies---items you need to complete and possibly have approved before you can start or complete other tasks?
- created any accounts you will need at external systems and confirmed that you can log into those accounts?
- determined where you will save your files and developed a plan for accessing those files from whatever computer(s) youâ€™ll be using?
- noted any explanations, justifications, or documentation that must be provided?
- reviewed expectations for citing sources, collaboration, or use of generative AI?
- identified any instructions about specific techniques you should be using?
- identified any instructions about specific techniques you should not be using?
- developed a personal schedule for doing the work which accounts for potentially getting stuck and needing help from your professor or PAL?

2. Before **completing** your work, have you...

- reviewed it to ensure it meets all of the assignment expectations you identified?
- tested any code in multiple contexts/on multiple inputs?
- reflected on your design choices?
- proofread any written content for spelling, grammar, and clarity?
- considered visiting the Writing Center for help revising your text?

3. Before **submitting** your work, have you checked for details about...

- where to include your name?
- what filename(s) to use?
- what file type(s) to use?
- length or size expectations for the assignment?
- where/how to submit your assignment?
- the assignment deadline and any late policies?
