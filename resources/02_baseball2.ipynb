    "\n",
    "It's sometimes easy to imagine sports data as \"neutral,\" but just like any kind of data there are potential ethics concerns. As always we should consider the stakeholders of any data set. Who stands to gain by a data set being handled well? Who could be hurt if that same data is handled poorly? In the case of the baseball data, we should consider that professional sports are a big business, which includes the professional livelihoods of not only players but lots of support staff. Representing a sport accurately can help the people who make their livings in that sport. Likewise, sports fans are deeply committed to their favorite players and teams, and accurate data collection and management can help those fans to better interact with the sport. Misrepresenting sports data could lead to certain players or teams being underfunded, or it could even lead to rule changes that might endanger athletes' health or overall ability to perform. Good sports analysis should always take the stakeholders into account and consider the ethical implications of any analysis.\n",

    "The data we will use comes from [baseball-reference.com](https://baseball-reference.com), a popular baseball statistics website. The site isn't *quite* equipped with the data we want, which is statistics on both batting and pitching at the same time. This is great for some purposes, but bad for ours! We'll need to do some data wrangling to remedy this.\n",

    "Now that we've gained some familiarity with the data, we want to see what factors might correlate with the number of runs each team scored in 2023. This is the `R` column from the original `batting` table, but it may have a new name now. This will be our *dependent variable* for all of our subsequent analysis.\n",

    "It's up to you to choose some *independent variables* that might correlate with the number of runs scored. To get a sense of the possibilities, **calculate the correlation matrix for all numerical variables in the dataset**. Alongside that, **visualize the correlation matrix in Altair**. [*In class we added labels to this graph, but there are too many variables here for that. Don't include the text labels this time, and make the graph big enough that it's readable. Focus on creating a clear, readable plot.*] **Accurately interpret both the plot and the statistical output.**\n",
