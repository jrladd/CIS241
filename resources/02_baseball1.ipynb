    "# The Best vs. The Rest\n",
    "## What *really* separates elite baseball teams?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Complete by: Tuesday 24 Sept. at 10:55am**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Sports analytics is one of the most popular and discussed forms of data analysis. No matter what sport interests you (gymnastics, football, skiing, etc., etc.), there is surely data out there, as well as lots of people looking for ways to analyze and better understand the sport. Sometimes, the purpose of the data is to win more games! This, after all, is the plot of the movie *Moneyball*, in which the Oakland A's use data analysis to recruit players and increase their chances of winning the pennant.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this week's sports data workshop, we'll work with a data set from the 2023 MLB season. **Sabermetrics**, the term for sports analytics with baseball data, is one of the oldest forms of sports data science. The box score was invented in 1858! Since the 1970s, analysts have examined the game of baseball from almost every conceivable angle, and this week we'll join the fray.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2023 a few teams performed spectactularly well: the Los Angeles Dodgers, the Atlanta Braves, and the controversial World Series-winning Texas Rangers. The Arizona Diamondbacks also had a surprisingly good run—they were National League Champions (i.e. second place in MLB) despite not scoring as many runs as other elite teams. Our question this week will be: is Arizona really that different from these other teams, in terms of scoring potential? Was their success the result of good play, random chance, or both?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Contextual and Ethical Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "It's sometimes easy to imagine sports data as \"neutral,\" but just like any kind of data there are potential ethics concerns. As always we should consider the stakeholders of any data set. Who stands to gain by a data set being handled well? Who could be hurt if that same data is handled poorly? In the case of the baseball data, we should consider that professional sports are a big business, which includes the professional livelihoods of not only players but lots of support staff. Representing a sport accurately can help the people who make their livings in that sport. Likewise, sports fans are deeply committed to their favorite players and teams, and accurate data collection and management can help those fans to better interact with the sport. Misrepresenting sports data could lead to certain players or teams being underfunded, or it could even lead to rule changes that might endanger athletes' health or overall ability to perform. Good sports analysis should always take the stakeholders into account and consider the ethical implications of any analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data we will use comes from [baseball-reference.com](https://baseball-reference.com), a popular baseball statistics website. The site isn't *quite* equipped with the data we want, which is runs per player per team. The data for players who played for multiple teams in a single season is automatically aggregated. This is great for some purposes, but bad for ours! We'll need to do some data wrangling to remedy this.\n",
