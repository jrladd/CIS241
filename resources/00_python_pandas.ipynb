    "Starting next week, your main homework for this class will be Workshop assignments based on real-world data. Since you're currently working on your Documentation assignment, this week you'll use this notebook to practice some of your new Python and Pandas skills. There isn't any writing in this assignment, but soon you'll use Jupyter notebooks to submit code and writing together.\n",

    "**For all of these instructions, do NOT repeat the exact variable names or data structures from our class slides or the guides. The variables you create and code you write should be new. You may use guides, documentation, and class notes to complete these tasks, but you may not use chatbots or AI code completion!**\n",
