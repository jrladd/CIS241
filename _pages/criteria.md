title: Criteria for Good Reports
permalink: /criteria/

In this course, you'll write data analysis reports in Jupyter notebooks, combining programming in Python with visualizations and written explanations. You'll turn in a report for each week's Workshop assignment, and your exams and final project will also take the form of a Jupyter notebook report.

Good data analysis requires the combination of clear writing, well-functioning code, and solid quantitative reasoning. Since these reports are a new genre you are learning in this class, you can follow this list of criteria for crafting good reports. I'll use the same criteria when I assess your work.

- **Focus and Organization**: All questions in the report are answered and all required sections are complete. Report is organized and easy to follow.
- **Writing**: Writing is clear, with all visualization and statistical output explained completely, accurately, and in terms of the data.
- **Code**: Code sections are complete and all code runs without errors. Code is well-commented and easy to read.
- **Statistics & Analysis**: All analysis is accurate and given in context, both in terms of the data and of the relevant statistical concepts.
- **Visualization**: Visualizations are clear, accurate, and well-labeled. Good visualizations should be readable on their own but also well-explained in writing.
