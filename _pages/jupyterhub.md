title: Setting Up JupyterHub

This page will help you get set up to use Python and JupyterHub, a data science and programming interface. You will use the Jupyter Notebook file `00_getting_started.ipynb`.

## Setting Up JupyterHub

1. Navigate to the [CIS JupyterHub](http://104.131.179.70).
2. Log in with your W&J username (the part of your email address before the @). ***Whatever password you enter for the first time will become your password. KEEP TRACK OF WHAT YOU ENTERED SO THAT YOU DON'T GET LOCKED OUT!***
3. Bookmark this page so you can always get back to JupyterHub.
4. That's it! You can use this site from any machine, and as long as you save your work, your files will follow you everywhere.

## Managing Files

1. On the left side of the screen you'll see a list of all the files in your JupyterHub. This won't show anything yet because you don't have any files yet.
2. To add a new file, copy this link to our file for today: <https://jrladd.com/CIS241/resources/00_getting_started.ipynb>. In JupyterHub, select File -> Open from URL at the top of the screen. Paste the URL into the box that appears. The file should now appear in your list! (You could also download the file to your computer and upload it to JupyterHub with the upload button, an upward pointing arrow next to the blue `+` button.)
3. To create a new blank Notebook file, you can always click the blue `+` button and select `Python 3` under Notebook. 
4. The button with a folder and a `+` on it will let you create a new subfolder. You can then drag files into or out of the various folders. You can organize things however you want, but I recommend developing an organization strategy early that works for you. By the end of the term we'll have a lot of files! You might create a folder for "workshops" and a folder for "class", for example.

Now you're ready to begin! Read through the Getting Started notebook and follow the instructions. You don't need to code anything yourself today---just follow the examples and get a feel for how Jupyter works.

*n.b. We're experimenting with JupyterHub for the first time this semester. If you experience any problems with how it works (e.g. it runs really slowly, files go missing, really anything that seems odd), let me know right away. You can always run Jupyter locally on your own laptop or on any of our classroom or lab computers. See this page for [instructions on working with Jupyter locally](/CIS241/jupyter).*
