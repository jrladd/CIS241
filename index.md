## Course Description

An introduction to the concepts and practices involved in data mining, this course addresses data mining activities in three phases: data preparation (or preprocessing), mining techniques, and classification and analysis. These concepts will be taught using industry-standard tools for data mining activities. Projects and assignments will be completed as students organize and mine data sets taken from various disciplines of study including marketing, finance, and natural and social sciences. 

## Learning Goals

At the end of this course, you should be able to:

- Understand and implement the data mining process, from project understanding to deployment.
- Use exploratory data analysis to quickly understand a complex dataset.
- Apply modeling techniques to make predictions.
- Evaluate the effectiveness of different modeling techniques.
