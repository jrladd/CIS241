As always, download the Jupyter Notebook file and dataset, and you'll work on the assignment in class on Thursday. You'll turn in the assignment by midnight Sunday, but we're changing the way we submit: instead of using the "Drop Box", go to the assignment on Sakai for this workshop and upload your Notebook file there.

This week we're working on data from the business world.
