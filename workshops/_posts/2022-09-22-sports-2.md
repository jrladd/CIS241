As always, download the Jupyter Notebook file and dataset, and you'll work on the assignment in class on Thursday. You'll turn in the assignment by midnight Sunday, but we're changing the way we submit: instead of using the "Drop Box", go to the assignment on Sakai for this workshop and upload your Notebook file there.

This week we're continuing on our work on tennis matches, but with a lot more data than before.
